# Comma Reader

Comma Reader will take in a string of length zero or greater and 
transform it into an array of strings by splitting the input on 
the comma characters. If a field is surrounded by quotation marks
then the quotation marks will be stripped off when the field is
output. Escaping quotation marks, or using quotations is not within
this particular comma reader, see comma2 when it appears for 
escaping behavior.
