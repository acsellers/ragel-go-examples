# Atof

Atof will take in a string and transform it into an float64. It should
cope with a + or - sign in the front of the string (optional) followed
by digits with an optional period sign followed by more digits. It 
should require that at least 1 digit falls before the period if it is
present and there should be at most 1 period within the string.
